\section{Analysis of Review}
After reviewing the above systems, it has been analysed that almost all the systems have their own specific format. These systems are not capable to offer custom services that are specific to various institutes that are affiliated to University of Mumbai.
\par
These systems lack customizability of various parameters that are dynamically controlled by the university. With such systems, still, there will arise needs to enforce manual workflows. These systems are made as per the standard format and does not provide flexibility as per the user requirements. All the systems have almost the same modules and major emphasis is given on admissions, student-staff relation and examination.  Major moto of the system is to integrate intra college activities into a single system.  Most of the systems also provide mobile apps for students and parents.
