This report specifies the various processes and techniques used in gathering requirements, designing, implementing and testing for the project on ‘ACPCE Transactional System Using OAuth 2.0’. Existing problems with current system in the institute was analysed and noted. This project aims to solve some of the problems by creating a core software, development platforms for future works and to set up necessary infrastructure for maintaining transactional data for the institute, thus, adding more value to the current system. The requirements were gathered from various institute departments and stakeholders, based on which, requirement was modelled. A web application, using Java, MySQL and frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, Apache, etc, was designed to fulfil the modelled requirements.
